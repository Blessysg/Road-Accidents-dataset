# Road-Accidents-dataset

# Overview:
- In this project, I employed a combination of tools including Power BI, Tableau, SQL Server Management Studio, and Excel to thoroughly analyze the database.
- This project utilizes Power BI to analyze road accident data, providing insights into various aspects such as casualties, types of accidents, geographical distribution, vehicle involvement, and more. 
- The analysis focuses on comparing current year statistics with the previous year, highlighting trends and patterns in road safety.
- These dashboard is designed to be completely dynamic and interactive, allowing users to navigate through the data using various filters and slicers. 
- The primary filter is based on road surface conditions, categorizing them into Dry, Snow, and Wet. By selecting a specific condition, users can access data on road accidents that occurred under that particular road surface condition.

# Dataset:
- This is a Road accident dataset for the yera 2021 and 2022.
- This data set has 21 columns
- Created a new table "Calendar" which has 4 columns 
- The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on road accidents, including casualties, accident types, vehicle involvement, road types, geographical areas (urban/rural), light conditions, and location specifics.

# Analysis:
- The analysis encompasses several key metrics and visualizations to offer a comprehensive understanding of road safety dynamics.

# Key Metrics:
- Primary KPI - Toatal Casualties value for current year and YoY growth.
- Primary KPI - Total Accident value for current year and YoY growth
- Primary KPI -  Toatal Casualties by accident severity for current year and YoY growth.
- Secondary KPI - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.
- Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year.
- Casualties by road type for current year.
- Current year casualties by area/ location & by Day/night.
- Total casualties and total accident by location.

# Additional Analysis:
- Casualties by Vehicle Type: Breakdown of casualties based on vehicle types involved in accidents.
- Monthly Trend of Casualties: Visualization of monthly trends in casualties, comparing the current year with the previous year.
- Casualties by Road Type: Distribution of casualties based on different types of roads.
- Casualties by Geographical Areas: Analysis of casualties in urban and rural areas.
- Casualties by Light Condition: Breakdown of casualties based on light conditions at the time of accidents.
- Casualties by Location: Analysis of casualties based on specific locations.

# Usage:
