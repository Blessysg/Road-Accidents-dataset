# Road-Accidents-dataset

Overview:

In this project, I employed a combination of tools including Power BI, Tableau, SQL Server Management Studio, and Excel to thoroughly analyze the database.
This project utilizes Power BI to analyze road accident data, providing insights into various aspects such as casualties, types of accidents, geographical distribution, vehicle involvement, and more. 
The analysis focuses on comparing current year statistics with the previous year, highlighting trends and patterns in road safety.
These dashboard is designed to be completely dynamic and interactive, allowing users to navigate through the data using various filters and slicers. 
The primary filter is based on road surface conditions, categorizing them into Dry, Snow, and Wet. By selecting a specific condition, users can access data on road accidents that occurred under that particular road surface condition.

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on road accidents, including casualties, accident types, vehicle involvement, road types, geographical areas (urban/rural), light conditions, and location specifics. The dataset is sourced from "Kaggle".

Analysis:

The analysis encompasses several key metrics and visualizations to offer a comprehensive understanding of road safety dynamics. Here are the main components of the analysis:

Key Metrics:

Current Year Casualties and Percentage Reduction: Comparison of current year casualties with the previous year, along with the percentage reduction.
Current Year Accidents and Percentage Reduction: Comparison of current year accidents with the previous year, along with the percentage reduction.
Current Year Fatal Casualties and Percentage Reduction: Comparison of current year fatal casualties with the previous year, along with the percentage reduction.
Current Year Serious Casualties and Percentage Reduction: Comparison of current year serious casualties with the previous year, along with the percentage reduction.
Current Year Slight Casualties and Percentage Reduction: Comparison of current year slight casualties with the previous year, along with the percentage reduction.

Additional Analysis:

Casualties by Vehicle Type: Breakdown of casualties based on vehicle types involved in accidents.
Monthly Trend of Casualties: Visualization of monthly trends in casualties, comparing the current year with the previous year.
Casualties by Road Type: Distribution of casualties based on different types of roads.
Casualties by Geographical Areas: Analysis of casualties in urban and rural areas.
Casualties by Light Condition: Breakdown of casualties based on light conditions at the time of accidents.
Casualties by Location: Analysis of casualties based on specific locations.
